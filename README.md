# BayesianForceInference_GoogleColab


# How to Use
Test sample:
1. Download files from [Github](https://github.com/Sugimuralab/BayesianForceInference_GoogleColab).
2. Upload them to your Google Drive. Make sure that you put BayesianForceInference.ipynb and lib/ in the same directory (YourDirectory/BayesianForceInference.ipynb, YourDirectory/lib/).
3. Select `InputData-ForceInference/Vertex/VDat_140408-T001.dat` as the input file in step 3.
4. Select `OutputData-ForceInference/' as the output directory in step 4. Alternatively, you can create a new directory and set it as the output directory.
5. Select the directory that you put this notebook, BayesianForceInference.ipynb, as the current working directory in step 5.

Your samples:
1. Download files from [Github](https://github.com/Sugimuralab/BayesianForceInference_GoogleColab).
2. Upload BayesianForceInference.ipynb and lib/ to your Google drive. Put them in the same directory (YourDirectory/BayesianForceInference.ipynb, YourDirectory/lib/).
3. Prepare an input file in the same format as `InputData-ForceInference/Vertex/VDat_140408-T001.dat`. **GetVertex**, a Fiji/ImageJ plug-in for generating such a file from a segmented image, is available from [Github](https://github.com/Sugimuralab/GetVertexPlugin).
4. Upload the input file to your Google Drive.
5. Select the input file in step 3.
6. Set an output directory of your choice in step 4.
7. Select the directory that you put this notebook, BayesianForceInference.ipynb, as the current working directory in step 5.
